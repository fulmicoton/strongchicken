What is it?
========================


strongchicken is a small python package aiming at helping people studying energy portfolios with
 - pricing,
 - optimization,
 - risk measurement.

It is also perfect to study/teach the basic concepts of pricing, asset optimization, and hedging.


Focus has been put on the power and the simplicity of the API, rather than on the performance.
However, thanks to the numpy library, performance are
still better than a badly written C++ pricer, and probably somewhere between 5 times and 10 times slower than a good C++ library. 

It is perfect for you to test, tweak, and play with complex models/assets, perform complex studies in a few hours.


Bug report and feature requests...
